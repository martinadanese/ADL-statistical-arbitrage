# Statistical Arbitrage

This is a repository for the project of Applied Deep Learning corse @ TUWien. As suggested by the name,
the topic of this project is _Statistical Arbitrage_, and the type is _Beat the stars_.

## idea and approach
Statistical Arbitrage (SA) is a short-term algorithmic trading approach, which aims at extracting a time-series signals 
of a portfolio of similar assets, in order to capture deviations. When the deviation is strong enough, it is possible to  
apply a trading policy, longing in one ore more stocks and shorting in others. It is worth noticing that SA does not depend on 
absolute stock prices, being it is market-neutral, but on a precise modelling of stocks relationships and open andclose position.
